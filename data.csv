tiktok,Comment,The mustard seed is the pet project of Jason Nixons father and they literally profit from keeping people unhoused and vulnerable. Kinda sketchy considering Jason Nixon is attacking the most vulnerable people with their unfair cuts to aish and making laws to protect slumlord landlords and make it harder for renters.

facebook,Comment,"I don’t know what’s going on with The Mustard Seed (but) as of true Christian faith should be responsible for the neighbourhood and area to look after the homeless and neighbourhood that they’re in. It’s only common sense as a Christian so I’m not sure what these people are all about, but I think they need to be taught more about Christianity and Jesus took care of everyone not just an organization🙏"

facebook,Comment,"here is a good neighbour plan.. I heard you've been working on it for 2 years? This took me about 12 minutes.

Prairie Manor Good Neighbour Plan
The Mustard Seed Prairie Manor Housing Project

NAME OF ORGANIZATION:
The Mustard Seed is a Christian non-profit organization that has been caring for individuals experiencing homelessness and poverty since 1984. Our vision is to eliminate homelessness and reduce poverty where we serve. Our mission is to build hope and wellbeing for our most vulnerable citizens through Jesus’ love.

Operating in five cities across Alberta and British Columbia, The Mustard Seed is a supportive haven where people can have their physical, mental, and spiritual needs met and grow toward greater health and independence.

We have been an agent of change for more than three decades, thanks to our donors, volunteers, and support from the community.

PROJECT INFORMATION:
The Mustard Seed is converting an existing hotel into a residential building in the Queen Alexandra Park community. The project will involve retrofitting 85 hotel units to create self-contained bachelor units that The Mustard Seed will rent as affordable supportive housing units. The building will undergo several renovations to supportive residential uses, and is anticipated to be completed by Summer 2022.

Upon completion of the required renovations, Prairie Manor will focus on housing marginalized and over-represented populations experiencing poverty. The Mustard Seed is committed to maintaining a 60% Indigenous tenant population and reserving 30% of units for women.

Prairie Manor is a direct response to a unique call to action across municipal and federal levels of government. As a recipient of CMHC’s Rapid Housing Initiative Program and the City of Edmonton’s Affordable Housing Investment Plan, Prairie Manor will contribute 85 supportive housing units as part of the Rapid Housing Initiative’s total target of 9,200 new affordable housing units across Canada.

It is imperative that The Mustard Seed expands our ability to serve those vulnerable neighbours at the same pace that the need is growing, and this new initiative will allow our organization to better support the community.

COMMITMENT:
The Mustard Seed is committed to engaging the neighborhood surrounding the community hub and responding to feedback and the resolution process as part of our pre-construction activities, during construction, and on an ongoing basis during operations of Prairie Manor. We will always do our best to facilitate open communication with our neighbours, and prioritize quick turn-around times for any community member inquiries on our initiative.

As part of our community engagement plan with our neighbours, communications will be facilitated in several different ways depending on the status of the project, including:

Mailed or delivered newsletters and pamphlets
Virtual survey on draft Good Neighbour Plan
Virtual and/or in-person open house events (subject to COVID-19 safety considerations)
Email notifications and correspondence
One-on-one phone and/or in-person meetings
Access to project information on our website (https://theseed.ca/prairie-manor)
Upon completion of construction, Prairie Manor will proactively engage and be a member of the Queen Alexandra Park Community League. The Mustard Seed will encourage our residents and staff to support local businesses and stakeholders, with the primary goal to have our residents invested and integrated into the neighbourhood.

Once Prairie Manor is operational, we will also invite community members into the space to connect with the community or see what it is all about! The Mustard Seed will also provide a direct contact for the supervisor of the housing program that can be utilized regarding a donation, volunteering, or a concern.

ELIGIBILITY:
The purpose of Prairie Manor is to provide affordable housing units to 85 individuals who have a history of difficulty maintaining market rent housing. In order to be eligible for housing, these individuals must meet the additional criteria below:

18+ years old
History of homelessness or difficulty maintaining market-rate housing
Meet the criteria for supportive housing as identified by a designated assessment tool
Income cannot exceed the Core Need Income Threshold (CNIT) as defined by the City of Edmonton

KEY ISSUES:
At time of drafting this Good Neighbour Plan, no key issues have been raised by the community. Upon compiling feedback from the Good Neighbour Plan survey, this draft Good Neighbour Plan will be updated to reflect community feedback and how The Mustard Seed intends to address these key issues.

RELATIONSHIP-BUILDING WITH COMMUNITY:
We are all neighbours in this area, and as neighbours, we all have a responsibility to care for our neighbourhood, engage in healthy change, and get to know each other as friends and community members.

We try to build these relationships by adding value to the neighbourhood such as facilitating community clean-ups, hosting community BBQ’s, and hosting block parties inclusive of everyone. These are a few ways in which we hope to build relationships in the neighbourhood. We are always open to new ways and ideas to connect, and would love to hear from you!

ISSUE RESOLUTION:
In case of emergencies, always call 911. If the concern is a non-emergency situation, call 211.

During the pre-construction and community consultation phase, please connect with the following team members:

For questions/comments on programming and engagement opportunities:

Megan Schuring, Director of Community Development meganschuring@theseed.ca

For questions/comments on permitting, approval, and construction processes:

Taylor Kawaguchi, Project Manager taylorkawaguchi@theseed.ca

Upon building completion, this Good Neighbour Plan will be updated to reflect the primary contact information for building operations and distributed accordingly.

Resolution Timelines:

If there is an issue or complaint that a community member would like to bring forward, The Mustard Seed has committed to the following resolution process:

1. Complaint Received:

Within two business days of receiving a complaint or concern from the community, The Mustard Seed’s program team will collaborate internally to develop a response plan
2. Response:

Within four business days, The Mustard Seed will connect with the complainant to establish a meeting to discuss the concern further, or a plan to address the concern
3. Follow-Up:

Within ten business days, The Mustard Seed will implement the plan with established responsibilities and timelines for resolution
4. Review:

Within ten weeks of the implemented action items, The Mustard Seed will follow-up with the complainant to review success and identify any additional barriers or concerns
Step 3 and 4 will be completed and/or repeated until the complaint has been considered resolved by all parties"

I used to take them to the Bissell Centre but they do not have the program for employable homeless.
For example, an employer would come in- looking for a few guys to work for the day but need hard hats, and perhaps other PPE."

facebook,Comment,Truly unfortunate.  This is sadly at the cost of so many that need these services. We must do better to support the most vulnerable. Thank you to you all at the mustard seed who continue to persevere and advocate for change.
facebook,Comment,"Many of us here in the Flats hope your organization finds the perfect new location, keeping in mind and guided by potential impacts on surrounding neighbourhoods."
facebook,Comment,"The ladies that work wellness are ridiculous! Who do they actually help? Do quick survey with other professionals. They will tell you to ask for help anywhere else! 
I'm sad there was no willingness to work with the city, to work with the neighbors, and law enforcement to ensure the people who are hungry can eat! Not everyone who accesses food supports are substance users. Now no one will be fed.
The Mustard Seed had soooo many opportunities to make this better and they chose not to. 
Unfortunately doing God's work was too much for them. Shame on the Mustard Seed 😡"

facebook,Comment,"I was able to use this location to shelter me during two daytimes. Only two, it's a lot more for most others. It was -25°C weather, and all I had to do was walk 15 minutes from the overnight shelter. I was a person in crisis. Does Medicine Hat (who greenlit this closure) think that by shutting this location down, that people in crisis will temporarily cease to exist? Unwell people are still going to mill about the area. If anything, neighbourhood complaints are going to get worse"

facebook,Comment,"This is so disheartening, I have utilized the mustard seed for meals many times because I can’t afford food on disability. I understand why it needs to move, but come on Medicine Hat be part of the solution not add to the problem. There were seniors there, 20 year olds, myself 40’s and countless others. We are all going to suffer from this! Doesn’t everyone have the right to basic human needs? Places like this should be honoured for the endless hard work, often without much thanks, volunteers that do it because they care.  The tougher times get the more these places will be needed. Thank you to The Mustard Seed I wouldn’t have eaten many times if you weren’t there ❤️🙏🏻"
facebook,Comment,"The issue of what needs to be done for people who are homeless, drug addicts, or suffering for mental illness on our streets rather than in a secure facility, keeping them and the public safe, is not up for debate. This we can agree on. The elephant in the parlour not addressed in your reporting or that offered by other news outlets in the city is that of the consequences of a facility of this nature being located in a quiet residential neighbourhood in which there are schools, children at play, and hard-working people who abide by laws and who, needless to say, pay the taxes, funding government here, and thus who have every right to expect our concerns to be heard with as much attention as those of an organization that appears not to give much of a damn about the effect their services and those who use them are having on said neighbourhood. I won’t go into the multitude of questions many of us have here in the Flats regarding what violations The Mustard Seed seems to have incurred to bring on this decision by the city. It would certainly be interesting to see what kinds of permits they have for the services they’ve been offering. The most important thing to me, and to many of us who live here is that the services not be interrupted since it is obvious there are some successes, but that the location for the services not be plonked down in the middle of a residential neighbourhood. Not sure why this is so difficult to understand. (Response to Medicine Hat News)"

facebook,Comment,"A follow up message after my last one:  People in major crisis being shunned to less integrated areas will cause more harm than good. Being the 'unwelcome other' doesn't get better when you're unable to be around the regular population. Also, with nowhere to go during the daytime, clients of the overnight Mustard Seed location will just spread out and cause disruptions in more neighbourhoods. I think having more staff at the daytime Mustard Seed location would be more helpful than shuttering it completely."

facebook,Comment,"Go on the City of Medicine Hat and go to e-permit and see for yourself that the Salvation Army never had a development or a zoning permit to operate at 737 8st. SE shelter either.  So, the question is, how did the Mustard Seed take over the shelter when it wasn't supposed to be there in the first place?  Also, how did the Mustard Seed get a Business Licence without a Development Permit?"

facebook,Comment,"When was the last time Alberta Health inspected the shelter in Calgary? That building should be condemned. Black mold, the bathroom & shower areas for both the women & men are a health hazard, you don't dare step barefoot when having a shower for fear of catching something. The so called lunch that is given is embarrassing; a single slice of cheap ham on buttered bread, and a bottle of water, sometimes a piece of fruit or a granola bar IF there were food donations. And you're expected to sleep on a maybe 3 inch thick 6ft long, 3ft wide mat on a concrete floor. 
The so called optional Sunday service isn't actually optional, it's a pastor with a microphone, a guitar and a large speaker which is turned up to almost full volume. It's so loud that a person has no choice but to leave the shelter for the day to get away from it.
Those are only just a few of the issues, it's a terrible environment and not at all safe for women"

It was nice that we could figure out our situation without having to worry how we were going to afford food and shelter at the same time.  The staff are lovely and it was nice to get to know the other guests too.  We became a support to each other.  Some need some extra help and some just need some extra space and that's okay too.  My dream is that this place will grow and be able to support those that need it!

Just wanted to to say that there may be some other things at play also. 
That get over looked. While starting your journey most people have more than one addiction, smoking, sex but one that isn’t recognized as much is sugar and carbs.  And it can pull you back into your other addiction, they are help people with addiction in Europe with the Carnivore and keto diet. It improves your health and gets rid of the sugar cravings that can result in relapse for some people. 
It might be something to consider.  Dot let your guard down 👍👍🙏"

None, the less my trust is in God and not in government. And if you belong to him, you don't need to be afraid of the future. He's got you covered and he can still bless you. In spite of the government, if you look in your bibles, he always did his greatest blessings were in time when the Economies were the worst, so don't lose heart to keep your eyes on him.

 with the right guidance , one can find what is hurting or lacking in ones body an mind ,that is  missing to make them feel “whole “ again … you can heal… sometimes you have to leave a environment , for your health, , for your mental survival,  for your wellbeing …
For a proper human intervention, for a better understanding , for your growth , an to be curious again for your inner child , within you …
thank -you , for the Mustard seed for all that you do… 
And for ones who need help , keep trying, keep hoping , do not become discouraged, keep seeking, and don’t give up , sometimes things take time too fall into place…"
facebook,Comment,Simply wonderful 🙏👏😍

facebook,Comment,Love this!
facebook,Comment,Our library is impressive.
facebook,Comment,I support mental health but not if you are forced to sign up for a religion you may not believe in and this is how the mustard seed works for both clients and employees. They will not help if you don't succumb to their beliefs and I have seen firsthand that as an employee you will not advance within the company unless you sign into their faith.  That's not for me

facebook,Comment,"Absolutely ....because there are world wide populations that have it much, much more hardship than yourself."
facebook,Comment,"till they shut the resource one down in your city removing your councelling and resources, food, laundry services, hygeine/ toiletries, clothing, social workers, mail services (for the unhoused) and the harm reduction supplies and narcan (helpful for even non users you never know accidental exposure happens) bus pass/ bus tickets if you REALLY need it, and a place to come and not be alone and options to do games and other activities. the mustard seed does much more than just a homeless shelter. they are there for low income induviduals and familes and many people forget its not just homeless adicts even though they need and deserve the support as well. they gave people access to housing outreach right there at least once a week, they had access to medical for those who do have issues accesing it especially without feeling judged.  ever tried to go to the hospital and even sometimes doctors as homeless or god forbid a homeless ADDICT? they don't get treated very well or taken seriously, i heard a dr at the hospital tell this dude he needed to stay for a week but once they seen he was homeless they made him leave right then and there with minimal care. why did they remove the MS in my city ? because the neighborhood was complaining about having to see them. even though it was there before most of them even moved here ... who see's that and decides they absoltely HAVE to move beside it and open a daycare knowing about the drug use? and then demands and whines and protests that they move or shut down a seriously needed reasource.. and as for the drug use in the neighborhood.. they dont have a home or shed to go use in.. they tried to be respectful of the children too and when aske to move they always respected that, and the crime. Yes there was crime but just like... lock ur shed dont keep your expensive toys and stuff outside, unprotected. i highly dobt they were stealing as a personal attack.. that's something that a person does when they are desperate and need help/support and are having issues. AND this neighborhood is litterally known for being not the best ANYWAYS."
facebook,Comment,Yes
facebook,Comment,Yes this is so amazing because now all these confused people that have been trying to get their mail because you guys were withholding their crucial and personal mail for the past 2-3 months to get their life back or to get a place or food after the run around you gave them.... so now all those people that could have been housed two or three months ago that HAD to stay on the streets because of your shenanigans can get their mail and now they can get housed.... yes all praise a corporate system that makes money off the vulnerable and has a BUILDING filled with offices like a Harry potter movie.....

facebook,Comment,"Suffering on the streets with NO washroom facilities, no running water. Nowhere to charge your phone to hear if you have a doctors appointment, or from loved ones , no food no clothing, & in pain…… sometimes I think no wonder people turn to drugs to numb the suffering,  sadly.
Thank heavens for places like the mustard seed."
facebook,Comment,following. What age can volunteer?
facebook,Comment,"Except the government itself is perpetrating a fraud which could direct an entire country in any direction; and it's been so since forever.

Life In Christ Re-shifts us into the reality in this short life. Purpose is realized & gifts we have & has a real place to exercise. Been at the bottom for a long time, then. WHAT GOD OFFERS EVERY HEART HUMBLY CRYING OUT TO HIM IS BEYOND UNDERSTANDING... BUT... WHEN SALVATION MEETS A HEART... THERE'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT WAY OF SEEING OTHER'S & LIFE. FAITH... it only takes Faith... to believe & reach out. It's that simple."

Even here in NFLD there's a couple of those hotels and well. It's turned into chaos and from what I see not just here it's happening everywhere .

facebook,Comment,"The problem is that charities like yours are run by 'free market' conservatives who CAUSE poverty, homelessness, and destitution in the first place by supporting lousy gov't policies (i.e. cutting taxes on rich ppl, taking money away from poor ppl). 

Is the Mustard Seed anything more than just a money laundering scam for rich people (and people like MLA Jason Nixon) to avoid paying taxes? And to indoctrinate the desperate into Evangelical Christianity - that supports the highly toxic Christian Right and MAGA movement? Seems so to me."

facebook,Comment,"Why not tell the Alberta gov't to REVERSE the enormous ONE-THIRD TAX CUT for corporations that Jason Kenney passed through the legislature?

Or is the The Mustard Seed not much more than just an elaborate tax write-off money laundering scheme/scam for a-holes like Jason Nixon to force anti-Christian Evangelical Bullshit down the throats of the destitute and desperate?"
facebook,Comment,Je fais un don annuel à cette organisation car je crois beaucoup en cette cause. 🥰
facebook,Comment,Gross 🤢 how this country operates like a third world country
facebook,Comment,"If only we'd voted for a government that cares about people - raising minimum wage, capping utility costs and rent control would help!"

The government has made a great choice to have your services included in the Saskatoon homeless crisis"
facebook,Comment,"Oh yeah, been there.   Leaving messages on bulletin board too.  

Thank heaven J doing much better."
facebook,Comment,What they need is to ship these migrants back home to their home country. Their home country needs them. Canada doesn't. They're not fleeing war. They're coming for free shit.
facebook,Comment,Alberta is the richest province in the country.  So you are asking the poorer people in the other provinces to feed them?  I bet you are the same people peddling the false starving Gazans too.  The only people there that are starving are the hostages.
facebook,Comment,Sorry but although when my kids were young although I never earned big money I always made enough to feed them. They were much more important than a new vehicle or fancy items just to keep up with the Jones

facebook,Comment,Kathy Beck Lynn Beck Chris Beck
facebook,Comment,Location: 503A Allowance Ave. SE
facebook,Comment,"Kids stuff too, or just adults?"
facebook,Comment,Try doing clothing drives in smaller towns ? We has one for fire evacuees and filled the hall.
facebook,Comment,"No Offense to anyone but, You should go back to your old policy that anyone that comes to get support must have proof that they really need your support.  i remember awhile back when that the person in need had to give bank records etc to prove that they were the unfortunate ones. And isnt that what the Food Bank is really for?  The unfortunate ones!"
facebook,Comment,"Can people pick up? I may have some clothes that I don’t wear but are still in good condition, but I also don’t drive, not home right now but will be within a day or so 😭"
facebook,Comment,For sure in the next few weeks🙏
facebook,Comment,Great! Put them by car dealership and condos! Lots to go through and steal there!
facebook,Comment,"How on earth is anyone supposed to get there? All the meals and services are around the downtown. Will they be expected to hike? 

Yes, that location is not I’m a residential area, but it just doesn’t seem practical."
facebook,Comment,My hubby and I will drop off a big lot of clothes next week!!
facebook,Comment,Could you explain where the 27.1 million dollars of funding went in 2024?
facebook,Comment,"They have to have a  location for the food and services of the homeless that is out of the downtown core....as well as accommodations.  Perhaps, a community could be built and situated on the land behind Lion's Park to make a multiplex design in a  warehouse type build and accommodating homeless  families, individual areas for single men and women. This build could include meal services, physical and mental help services, as well as support staff 24/7 and on the job training for individuals. People would have the HOPE  to be able to get back to living  a normal life once again.
The existing homeless situation is plaguing all cities and towns....like 'a dog chasing his tail'. Perhaps, if a group of people established a working model in one small city, over a period of 5 years the kinks could be outed;
success for other centres on the horizon."
facebook,Comment,"Substance use will not be permitted on shelter property - but - substance free spaces will be available? That doesn't really make sense, does it?"
facebook,Comment,"The Mustard Seed is an essential service in my opinion. The proposed location is totally ridiculous. The goal is to help those that need it but by moving it out to the fringe of the city makes it very difficult to access. You can bet some that were taking advantage of their services will have no means to get there, so why bother. The homeless problem is just going to grow and downtown & the Flats will be seeing more & more of them as the seasons change. But then again, this council has proven to be the worst of all those before it."
facebook,Comment,Another poor decision omg can you not see what other centers have done
facebook,Comment,"Crouse's Cleaners 
GPYESS - Sunrise House
Odyssey House
The Mustard Seed
Grande Prairie Friendship Centre"
facebook,Comment,"I’m wondering the same how is it possible for them to come from that location to down town where they go to eat and to deal with housing and other essential needs. IS THE CITY GOING TO PROVIDE THEM  BUS SERVICE?
MOST HAVE NO MONEY. Please think about the cold weather we have in this city"
facebook,Comment,The Supervised Consumption Site should move there too..  get them out of bussesiness and residential areas.. we want are safe streets back for our children
facebook,Comment,Maybe they can have a bus service out there lmao
facebook,Comment,"Good place for them to learn to budget their time and money. Also, cooperation with the other shelter residents. Those that are there who legitimately want to make changes in their lives, should be okay with that. 🧐"
facebook,Comment,That is so nice ... thanks!
facebook,Comment,Thank you Waqar Khan
facebook,Comment,Just asking why we need the Mustard Seed - the Root Cellar and the Salvation Army provide very similar services and are already in place?
facebook,Comment,They are all beautiful!
facebook,Comment,Why don't they just get off the drugs and get a job? They get help every month while some people that physically can't work can't even get AISH. BS
facebook,Comment,"Its not a good location.  Its clear that the negotiations for the location never included actual homeless people.  The reason the homeless you do see that are downtown (not all homeless people live downtown that is false narrative)  is that's where the services are.  Things like a public library. the provincial building, second hand clothing stores, social services etc are all downtown.  To access this area there is only two ways. Use the number 1 highway or through on 3rd st NE  in riverside. Which you have to climb a significant hills to do so. This limits mobility. Which means bike thefts will go up as that is the most affordable and reliable form of transportation.  Homeless shelters should be where homeless people are at.  Transportation barriers means you will still see social disorder downtown. There is population density there. Where there is populations there is demand for drugs, sex and labor. So people will continue to go downtown as that is where there is both plenty of supply and demand.  The one way to limit homelessness is build affordable homes. Not bandaids like shelters.  So maybe instead of the UCP affiliated mustard seed (its ran by the nixon family who has minister in their caucus) they can build tiny homes in that location. And surround it by support services.  That wont get rid of all homelessness, but it would reduce it."
facebook,Comment,"Clearly the powers who be are not looking at all the logistics to this. 🙄 didn't actually think politicians would use commone sense or rational thinking did you? It's about placateing the neighborhoods. #NIMBY it's a real thing, but it's already in our backyards when it's everywhere.... these damn politicians need some reality checks and/or some lived experience. How about they all live on the living salary most people are required to live on and I bet they would find more feasible solutions to these social issues. 🤔"

facebook,Comment,25 years ago I was a new Red Deer College grad. I was working at Dawe School as an Educational Assistant. I had a student that I knew was hungry. I was trying to help when my Grandpa’s best friend who was a volunteer at the Mustard Seed helped me get a lunch for that boy. All those years ago volunteers at the Mustard Seed were making a difference in Red Deer. God Bless each one of you.

facebook,Comment,Will donate directly on the website and not through a Facebook link. Can't be to careful nowadays and that's my advice to other people donating. Go and do it directly on their website. Don't click any links in Facebook as they could be fake and scam artists

facebook,Comment,"why are you not out in the open , like your hiding from the public in these pictures. Or, is it the ""not in my Neighbourhood"" thinking?"
facebook,Comment,Thank you for caring
facebook,Comment,
facebook,Comment,It is such a blessing to serve our vulnerable community members.  Their warmth and gratefulness truly makes this the best part of my week 💖

facebook,Comment,The Mustard Seed Will you have a necklace class in November?
facebook,Comment,Have you decided where your new building will be yet?  Is it up to you or must City Hall approve?
facebook,Comment,Well done to both - thanks so much for coming out and supporting The Mustard Seed School Lunch Program! 🫡
facebook,Comment,"It's an extreme shame though and disappointment that MHPS forcefully discontinued your guyses ability to bring and serve the vulnerable community members in the parks/downtown area where MOST of them are forced to reside.... (since our only shelter only has 30 beds and we have WELL OVER 30 homeless in our community......) especially now that most days are extremely cold and they're spent struggling to keep warm either forced to stay continuously moving just to keep some body heat or they will literally freeze to the pavement, not a single place let's them in to warm up every single business locks any and all doors by 8pm, transit terminal lobby kicks anybody out after 15 minutes no matter what, 500$ tickets to anybody loitering anywhere and everywhere is private property even the goddamned PARKING LOTS!!! God forbid any of the homeless try to build any sort of a makeshift shelter for the night... it is absolutely heartwrenching seeing groups of people in my community huddling like penguins trying as hard as they can to simply survive, to keep warm against cold cement in this freezing weather, 

But of course as I was mentioning,  the ridiculous outrageous decision MHPS forced you guys into of serving at the old arena because they'd rather ""out of sight out of mind"" and not bother any of the uptight ignorant scumbags of our society whom judge and belittle and bully our street folk and shun them as if ignoring the issue will make it no longer exist! We have multiple folk with walkers, MS diabetes, knee injuries/replacements.... various folk with impairments that cause them the inability to arrive at such an out of the way destination let alone for the HOUR that the brown bagged breakfasts are served for which in turn is no longer a positive thing. This has gone from being an awesome help for plenty into a rather disappointing disadvantage for PLENTY of our at risk community members who already don't get meals on weekends but are now forced to be facing extreme cold temperatures leading to frostbite and various other struggles due to our cities oh so open strong willingness to be compassionate leading to Mustard Seed meal on wheels for those in need being forced into being unable to efficiently successfully impact those who need it for survival......... I hope MHPS and the ""not in my neighborhood"" folk are all proud and feel great about themselves this holiday season knowing they've only done further detriment to plenty of lives whom had already been struggling more than most could handle whilst remaining tolerant and coping."
facebook,Comment,This is amazing! Do you ever need volunteers to help prepare/serve breakfast?

facebook,Comment,"Hi Mustard Seed team. Do you approve of the way this organisation used their gigantic platform to publicly honour the organisation's unrepentant sexual predator founder, Bill Hybels, this year? Does the harm Hybels did to the many women he sexually abused matter at all?

facebook,Comment,As soon as Jason Nixon gives up his pension from you and is no longer a minister I will consider donating again
facebook,Comment,They cater to immigrants in Calgary

facebook,Comment,"We need your help in Leduc, no shelter, no soup kitchen, only those with a physical address permitted to use the food bank. So many restrictions in place Leduc may need to have a place built that can meet the infinite demands of the Locals to ensure they don't have to 'see' or 'deal with' their fellow Human Beings who struggle."
facebook,Comment,the UCP are just creating more customers.
facebook,Comment,imagine if gretzky stayed playing at that age  he would have had 1100 goals lol
facebook,Comment,"Single white males need help, too.  minorities and women, and kids are always the first to get help from our social systems. The shelters are full of aging single white males who can't get subsidized housing or wages or into free training programs or any sort of help at all because the immigrants and natives and women and children and everyone else comes first. Why can't we all be considered equals?"
facebook,Comment,Mustard Seed is owned by the family of UCP MLA Jason Nixon.
facebook,Comment,"I donate monthly to the Mustard Seed, and I also purchase 100 meals each for the Hope Mission at all their celebrations.
I'm retired I can only donate so much."

facebook,Comment,i do ! when can i pick it up ?

facebook,Comment,One of my favorite monthly donation options.
facebook,Comment,"Need to see how you manage your newest project on 31st W in Saskatoon, especially after hearing about the Medicine Hat, AB issues. Donating to other sources to help in the meantime."
facebook,Comment,I will do that in my usual way!!
facebook,Comment,donated today
facebook,Comment,I’d like to know if the full amount goes to the cause; not to executives?
facebook,Comment,Giving elsewhere until we know more about the Medicine Hat issues with your organization!
facebook,Comment,Near your facility you devalue all other property value and perpetuate the homeless industrial complex
facebook,Comment,Who knew Gerard Butler had fallen on hard times?
facebook,Comment,Nice toque.
facebook,Comment,I have very little money but would willingly give my time to be helpful where needed.
facebook,Comment,There are so many transient homeless people to accommodate for the night. The turn over must be high. Lots of pillows and blankets are needed and to be cleaned to accommodate the next group. I wondered how often they are cleaned. I thought the Mustard Seeds can do more with the pillows I like to donate. They are all intact and washed. I believed mine would be welcome by those who can’t afford a place to stay. It was to my disappointmentmy washed and clean pillows were not accepted.
facebook,Comment,I can't eat those!
facebook,Comment,Wife been knitting wool touges..mitts..slippers all year for the unfortunate..had to just drop off at back door on west end
facebook,Comment,It's kind of hilarious that Mustard Seed won't actually profile the people who use the service.  Instead they use a generic AI photo of a white guy (or maybe its a real pic idk) to try and get money through false sense of racial solidarity.  Show us all the aboriginals you want us to pay for instead.  Let's be really really real about what the demographics are that you want us to Fork over money to support.
facebook,Comment,I used to support this group until I found out how much is actually going to those in need. Shame on Mustard Seed
facebook,Comment,"""Blurry"" Justin Yap 😎"
facebook,Comment,How wonderful 🎉
facebook,Comment,
facebook,Comment,Go check out the shelter….mostly immigrants working there and place priority on sheltering other immigrants

facebook,Comment,The mustard seed is owned by rich family so why would I donate ????
facebook,Comment,Alberta needs a government that isn't trying to privatize everything so the poor people die off.
facebook,Comment,"I can donate a flashlight so they stop shitting,and pissing at entries to our building."
facebook,Comment,My son works at the Mustard Seed in Medicine Hat. Your choosing to make a difference in the lives of our vulnerable is much appreciated. ❤️

facebook,Comment,Ask Jason Nixon t fund more shelters!
facebook,Comment,"Years ago, my dad Ron Zabrok set up a planned giving life insurance policy with the Mustard Seed Mission as the owner and beneficiary. My dad got the tax receipts for the life insurance premiums. When he dies, the Mustard Seed collects the death benefit. 

But they have to keep waiting. My dad is going to be 101 in a few months, and he ain't dead yet! Hahaha"
facebook,Comment,This is an excellent Edmonton community service well worth our support. I personally know some present and former workers who sacrifice to serve others in need.
facebook,Comment,"Jillian, you both have done an amazing job and there are many children that have benefited greatly from your kindness."
facebook,Comment,Instead of creating housing in warehouses how about housing  in homes
facebook,Comment,I know that you use warehouses for shelters..is it because of outta sight outta mind thinking ...maybe your shelter should be downtown again so people can see the need and do better
facebook,Comment,Quit making excuses and get your damn shit together…. You COULD make it work but no….. you’re creating a dangerous environment by not providing a shelter… FIGURE IT OUT FAST
facebook,Comment,WINTER HAPPENS THE SAME DAMN TIME EVERY YEAR GET YOUR DAMN ACT TOGETHER ALREADY LIVES ARE AT RISK
facebook,Comment,"Christians
 Have no part with the LAWLESS, PAGAN religion of christianity, it has nothing what-so-ever to do with the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They know nothing about the REAL Yeshua the Hebrew/Jewish Messiah of the bible. They worship some lawless, pagan Greek blasphemous Jesus Christos..""Christos"" (epithet). 
Prov. 28:9 ""If a person will not listen to the law, (those in the Christian religion), even his prayer is an abomination"".
 I submit to you, if we could arise a pagan from the grave, he would feel right at home in most of the proclaimed churches today. He would feel comfortable keeping all the pagan fertility gods & goddesses orgies/holidays: christmas, (Sol-Invictus/Saturnalia/Brumalia orgies), halloween, (All-Saints Day orgie), valentines day, (Lupercalia orgy), easter, (goddess of Ishtar/Isis/ orgies), and lent, (Tammuz), etc.. He would feel right at home in most churches. He would, in fact, probably be an elder.  FLEE BABYLON!  
Rev. 17:5 and on her forehead a name [was] written, a mystery,  “BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.” 
Rev. 18:4 Then I heard another voice out of heaven say: “My people, come out of her! so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not be infected by her plagues,

Thanks! You guys crush it every day 🧡"
facebook,Comment,So is there currently NO overnight shelter for the street folk in Medicine Hat??
facebook,Comment,I gotta think even  unfinished shelter with heat and out of the wind has to be better than sleeping outside.
facebook,Comment,"So what are your plans now? 

When will receive an update on finding a new location?

Why has the issue dragged on so long since you were initially informed you were required to move from your old location?

Thank you."
facebook,Comment,"I understand what you have said, however I still think it would better then the street under the bridge or door way."
facebook,Comment,"Ok.. fair enough BUT any sort of shelter, is better than being snowed or rained on. It provides SOME warmth!! Doesn’t make sense."
facebook,Comment,"Back in the day Aussies worked the ski hills and Canadians went to Australia for work.
Commonwealth just like moving down street from Calgary to Melbourne in one night.
Bring that 16 hour trek back."

facebook,Comment,Maybe they could get a job and stop feeling sorry for thier bad choices in life.
facebook,Comment,What
facebook,Comment,How about they stop stealing from the community and cleaning up after themselves and I am sure people would cut them some slack.
facebook,Comment,Jason Nixon and his family own Mustard Seed. He is trying to literally Destroy Aish!!
facebook,Comment,"This is the worst time to be asking for donations! Everyone is struggling to find a way to provide a Christmas for their loved ones and at the same time still pay bills and stupidly high rents, car payments, etc. and not just these guys but everyone! Turn on the tv at dinner time and every commercial is some abused dog or starving child or old lady or people in a war torn country or crippled children? Enough with the guilt trips and begging people for money that can barely afford to feed themselves!"
facebook,Comment,"while I understand the terrible expense, I feel some things could be done slower than others, which is more acceptable freezing on the street or some discomfort in a ware house."
facebook,Comment,Better than going to the Hope Mission these days.
facebook,Comment,Dont give them a dime!
facebook,Comment,What about churches that sit empty except when there are sermons they could easily give shelter at night.
facebook,Comment,"Michael Logan and his wife have 2 black and white pups. Super friendly and they do sometimes adventure around. She owns Mustard Seed and her name has totally escaped me. If anyone can tag them.

facebook,Comment,"leave them in bus shelters , way better"
facebook,Comment,"You guys overthink everything because of insurance & nothing else. Any building that has 4 walls & a roof is far better that living out on the streets especially with winter upon us. The homeless endure the weather, no bathrooms or showers or heat on a daily basis, and your worried about making sure you have all the comforts  before declaring it livable? Give you're damn heads a shake."
facebook,Comment,So proud of TMS
facebook,Comment,"Has the former arena been considered for the Mustard Seed?  It already has washrooms and showers, laundry, and kitchen facilities.  It may not be perfect, but it would at least have basic needs covered until renos can be done."

 One thing I'm most perplexed about, after all these years now,no long term commitments have been made to combat homelessness,yes I am aware it's a complex situation, even after all these years the band aid approach is still being made.
Keep up the good work The Seed and all the seedlings.

Rubber matts to sleep on 
Slop for food 
You only might get a blanket 
Garages masquerading as help centers.

You're a crooked hotel that charges back to the city per head. You run at a profit margin. Understaffed on purpose, paying shit wages. You make your bonuses by cutting throats. You're a snitch center for the violent, depraved police.

Miserable, evil shit holes. You evil bastards. Jesus Christ is your corporate figure head, not your teacher. You're evil."

facebook,Comment,I just spoke to a homeless veteran at a service station near the Medicine Hat homeless shelter?  The temperature was minus 21 and a wind chill made
facebook,Comment,"Sorry, I’m so angry I can’t text!!  Minus 21.  The fellow had such bad frostbite on one hand his fingers were swollen cracked and oozing blood, etc.  I suggested the shelter as we were close.  He wasn’t a local fellow.  He informed me he had been kicked out of the shelter by a tall, African-Canadian staff member.  He was trying to get downtown by the back of the Esplanades where he knew there was a cubby that the sun warmed up.  Are you serious, I would not donate a dime to the Mustard Seed and I hope others rethink their donation. Cruel and inhumane treatment that we wouldn’t do to an animal"
facebook,Comment,"This is the original location of the Mustard Seed.  We had a Decommissioning service a few months ago, so we aren't using it anymore.  It's been a safety hazard for a long time.  It's sad, though.  I work for the The Mustard Seed and this has been a location for a lot of lives being changed for the better: people got helped getting housed, entering a sobriety program, receiving a warm meal, meeting friends, and gaining hope.  Interesting trivia fact: this was the last place Red Robin burgers were served in Alberta.   Red Robin donated their burgers to the evening meal there.   It's a landmark and a place of good memories, however our work has been now spread out through the city.  Prayers that no one got hurt during this fire."

facebook,Comment,The Mustard Seed
facebook,Comment,"Your centers are shit holes of hateful cruelty. Rubber matts. Slop to eat and in small amounts. You only might get a blanket at night. You herd them into a glorified warehouse and they live like refugees in earthquake zones.

Your staff are too few, your services are thin. You're a profiteer of human misery. And worst of all, you've made Jesus Christ into a corporate figure head, same is true at the deplorable Salvation Army and drop-in center in Calgary, gulags of despair and hopelessness. 

You only care about profit margin. The animals who run the show are in it to make bonuses and you CHARGE BACK TO THE MUNICIPALITY PER HEAD... you're a business and you treat these people like criminals and animals. 

Fuck off and die. You're evil. COCKSUCKERS"

facebook,Comment,"Donated to my most local, Red Deer. Every bit helps!"
facebook,Comment,Where does the donations go? How much is operating cost and how much is actual given to the people at the bottom?
facebook,Comment,Elves are of Satan and Santa was a fat joke.  The mustard seed is biblical and should be representing JESUS CHRIST AND THE HOLY BIBLE.  EVERYONE WHO WIRKS AT THE MUSTARD SEED NEEDS TO HE OF JESUS CHRIST OR DONT WORK THERE.  JESUS CHRIST IS LOVE TRUTH COMPASSION so if your not of Jesus Christ you are not filled with the Holy Spirit and you need to stop working with the homeless because you don't know who they are to Jesus!!!  They are God's who is Jesus Christ Romans 13 own treasured possesions.  They are TREASURED POSSESIONS OF GOD THE MOST HIGH.  Anyone who works with them needs to treat them how God wants them to be treated.  How can you do that when you belong to Satan?  If you do not belong to Jesus Christ you belong to the devil that's biblical.  Ask Jesus Christ into your heart today.  No one should be of Satan working with God's most valued chosen people because they are not safe.  People who do not belong to Jesus are not safe.  That's truthful.  Straight up get with the Holy Bible and learn how to treat them properly.  If you harm them in any way GOD WILL HARM YOU.  What is the mustard seed???  What does it mean?  Omg please start hiring people who belong to Jesus Christ because homeless people need safety not evil.  Anyone who is not of Jesus Christ doesn't have the Love or compassion doesn't have the Holy Spirit and is capable of mistreating them.  That's not good.  You should make it a rule to hire people who know what the mustard seed represents.  Having faith as big as the mustard seed you can move a mountain.  The mustard seed is the smallest seed so all you need is faith.
facebook,Comment,I have a question. So if the shelter beds are full can the unhoused camp outside on the shwlter parking lot of yard waiting for a bed?
facebook,Comment,Hey Chaplain  Dave George Stanyer here Bonnie and I are doing well but Gord at the Mustard Seed is not doing well could you drop by and see him?

facebook,Comment,History repeats itself Hitler is the Canadian government and the shelters are the concentration camps of Hitler instead of giving the soldiers the meth to murder the Jews they give the Jews the meth to murder themselves.  They murder all innocent RCMP members through the streets and drive around a portable incinerator celebrating the murders of innocent RCMP members in front of all the homeless trauming them out further than falsely advertising to everyone that the homeless are addicted to drugs and suffer from mental health is their fault.  It's not it's the government making you hate them.  Those are God's treasured possesions.  Read the Bible.  Sleeping in tents is your idea....taking them into your care is the Lord's directions so rise up grab someone homeless and take care of them.  During Hitler people were hiding people in all areas of their homes that's what you should be doing. I'm not a loser not am I lying.  This is truthful and I've WITTNESSED it first hand.

instagram,Comment,"They suggested it to me at @themustardseedyyc - a homeless shelter I was sent to while in a brain injury clinic thanks to a workplace injury.  WCB sent me to that shelter, due to my landlord illegally giving me notice to move out after the accident.  MAID was extremely nice, and happy to get me signed up...... thank God my brain started working better again, and I was able to start thinking for myself properly, and get back on my feet.  The Mustard Seed employee told me my neurological issues were too much for them to accommodate, and pointed to the MAID advertisement on the wall, and asked if I ever considered MAID as my option.  Thanks @cbihealth for the great suggestion to go there!  Our system is ridiculous."

instagram,Comment,"My parents were homeless. My father died in 2015, and my mother in 2022. I make a visit every year to light a candle for them. We have the means to house everyone that needs shelter, we are choosing not to. It's not a matter of 'Lack of money/resources', we all know that's not true. It's a lack of empathy, and an over abundance of Greed."

instagram,Comment,Will there be a new location opening for the mustard seed? Sad to know that the Allowance Ave location is closing. Praying for better and bigger opportunities for the society that looks out for our most vulnerable community members 🙏🏻🫶🏻
instagram,Comment,"That’s so crazy, that you would be shut down in the middle of winter while we are in an extreme cold alert?"
instagram,Comment,So sad this is happening now. Unbeliythe city didn't extend the permit another 6 months.
instagram,Comment,So sad that you have to close in the middle of February. I am still shocked the city didn't extend the permit until the summer or until a new location was found.
instagram,Comment,"That your services are needed is not up for debate. Your Centre's location, and the disruptions of public order it creates in a residential neighbourhood near schools and preschools, among law-abiding, hard-working citizens who would have an easier time wishing you well if you cared as much for our concerns as you do for your clients, is always going to be a problem, for us and for you. The sooner you get moved to a more appropriate location, the better for you, for your support from the community, and for the people you assist. It's that simple."
instagram,Comment,That’s really sad.
instagram,Comment,This is absolutely awful…I do hope our city will have another solution for our most vulnerable. Thank you @themustardseedyxh for your unwavering support and services you’ve provided.
